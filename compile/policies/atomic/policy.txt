let commit = some "commit"
let store = some "sink"
let new_resource = some "new_resource"
let auth_check = some "check_rights"

Always:
If commit flows to store,
then
    (commit flows to auth_check)
    and
    (if commit flows to new_resource, 
    then new_resource does not flow to auth_check)
    and 
    (auth_check has control flow influence on the store).
