let commit = some "commit"
let store = some "sink"
let some_new_resource = some "new_resource"
let all_new_resource = all "new_resource"
let auth_check = some "check_rights"

If commit flows to store and commit flows to some_new_resource,
then commit flows to auth_check and all_new_resource does not flow to auth_check
