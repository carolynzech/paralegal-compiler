// Backwards-compatible version for current WebSubmit policies (i.e., write policy based on existing markers)
Always:
1. For each "sensitive" that flows to some "sink":
    a. For each "scopes" that flows to the call site associated with "sink":
        i. input flows to "scopes" only via some "safe"
        or
        ii. 
            1. input flows to "scopes" only via some "safe_with_bless"
            and
            2. some "bless_safe_source" flows to some "safe_with_bless"

// Version where policy comes first (ignoring existing markers)
Always:
1. For each "sensitive" that flows to some "store":
    // I added this -- not critical, but ensures that each store is in fact attributed to some actor (otherwise b. can be vacuously true)
    a. There exists some "actor" that flows to "store"
    and
    b. For each "actor" that flows to "store":
        // this is my approximation of "actor is an admin or a presenter"
        i. "admin" flows to "actor"
        or
        ii. "presenter" flows to "actor"

// Alternate version (with definition)
Definition:
1. *authorized actor* is:
    a. All "actor"s such that:
        i. "admin" flows to actor"
        or
        ii. "presenter" flows to actor"

// Definitions let you reason about set membership.
// I may not support this "is an" feature in my first draft (just to start smaller), 
// but I think eventually it'd be a good feature for the CNL to have.
Always:
1. For each "sensitive" that flows to some "store":
    a. There exists some *authorized actor* that flows to "store"
    and
    b. For each "actor" that flows to "store":
        i. "actor" is an *authorized actor*
