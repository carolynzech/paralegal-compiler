let community_struct = some "community"
let delete_check = some "community_delete_check"
let ban_check = some "community_ban_check"
let write = some "db_write"

Always:
If community_struct flows to write,
then 
community_struct flows to delete_check and 
delete_check has control flow influence on write and
community_struct flows to ban_check and
ban_check has control flow influence on write
