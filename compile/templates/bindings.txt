always compiles to:
 - marked_nodes for all variables (don't care about anything per-controller)
   <body>

sometimes compiles to:
 - let found = ctx.all_controllers().find(|(ctrler_id, _)| 
    { declare bindings (all_nodes_for_ctrl(*ctrler_id) ...)
      <body> 
    })

In <ctrler> compiles to:
 - same as sometimes
 - then check that found = <ctrler>'s id
